    "### Why Deploy to an Endpoint?\n",
    "So far, we‚Äôve seen how to run models locally, which is useful for experimentation. However, in a production setting, a forecasting model is typically just one component of a larger system. Running models locally doesn‚Äôt scale well and lacks the reliability needed for real-world applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this, we deploy models as **endpoints** on AWS. An endpoint acts as a **hosted service**‚Äîwe can send it requests (containing time series data), and it returns forecasts in response. This allows seamless integration into production workflows, ensuring scalability and real-time inference."

    "    * **past_covariates**: Dictionary containing the past values of the covariates for this time series.\n",
    "        - Each key in **past_covariates** correspond to the name of the covariate. Each value must be an array consisting of all-numeric or all-string values, with the length equal to the length of the **target**.\n",
    "        - Covariates that appear only in **past_covariates** (and not in **future_covariates**) are treated as past-only covariates.\n",
